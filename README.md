Hybrid Approach:
For the Hydropnoics/water-quality use The Arduino to read the  analog values (pH, EC, water level) and then send the data  to the Raspberry Pi over serial USB. The Pi can then log the data, render a web front end, or run further analysis.

Calibration:
For pH and EC/TDS sensors
For pH and EC/TDS sensors especially, you must perform calibrations against known solutions. Document the calibration curves and – if possible – store calibration constants so your code applies the correct conversions. 

Libraries and Dependencies:
Ensure that you have installed the proper libraries (e.g., Adafruit’s libraries for DHT and smbus for I²C) and that you’ve enabled interfaces (SPI for the MCP3008, I²C for pH and EC sensors) in the Raspberry Pi configuration

Testing and Debugging:
Always test and verify one sensor at a time. Use serial monitors (or terminal output) to see your sensor’s raw values before applying conversion formulas.

By following these guidelines and adapting the sample code to your specific sensor models (and reading their datasheets for any idiosyncrasies in communication protocols), you’ll be well on your way to integrating a temperature sensor, pH sensor, EC/TDS sensor, and water level sensor using your Raspberry Pi and the Elegoo Uno R3. This approach lays a practical foundation for everything from environmental monitoring to automated hydroponics systems.

# Arduino.1
This is an approach that assigns the heavy lifting of sensor sampling to the Elegoo Uno R3 (acting as an I²C slave), 
while the Raspberry Pi (acting as the I²C master) periodically polls the Uno to retrieve up‑to‑date sensor values. 
In this architecture, the Uno continuously reads the temperature, pH, EC/TDS, and water level sensors and stores 
calibrated values in global variables. When the Pi requests new data over I²C, the Uno sends a formatted string with all sensor readings. 
This lets you leverage the Pi’s superior networking and data‑logging capabilities while using the Uno’s analog inputs and sensor libraries to sample the environment.

A quick note on wiring:
Because the Arduino operates at 5 V logic and the Raspberry Pi uses 3.3 V on its I²C 

Elegoo Uno R3 Slave Code (Arduino)
In the following code sample, the Arduino uses the built‑in Wire library to act as an I²C slave at address 4. 
It also uses (for example) a DHT11 for temperature/humidity, and analog inputs for the pH sensor, EC sensor, and water level sensor. 
(Make sure to adjust pin assignments, sensor types, and calibration coefficients based on your hardware setup.)

Explanation

1. Sensor Updates: The loop() function periodically reads the sensors and updates the global variables.
2. I²C Request Handling: The requestEvent() callback packs the latest sensor readings into a formatted string  and writes it to the I²C bus.
3. Calibration:  The Multiplication factors ( e.g., 3.5 for pH and 100 for EC) are examples. Use known calabration standards to fine-tune these.

Raspberry Pi Master Code (Python)
Using the Python  (or ) library, the Raspberry Pi initiates I²C communication to request the latest sensor readings from the Uno.
see ----- main.py file

Explanation:
I²C Master: The Pi uses  to communicate on the I²C bus.
Data Request: The  function issues a read transaction. The Uno’s response—the formatted string of sensor values—is then decoded.
Polling Frequency: The Pi polls every 2 seconds, matching the Uno’s update frequency.

Advantages of This Architecture
Dedicated Sensor Sampling: The Uno handles all analog sensor readings and real‑time updates without being limited by the Pi’s lack of analog inputs.
Enhanced Data Processing: The Raspberry Pi (as master) can concentrate on data logging, network transmission, or running a GUI dashboard.
Clear Role Separation: This design leverages the timing‐sensitive tasks on the Arduino while using the Pi’s computing power for more advanced data processing and remote communication.
