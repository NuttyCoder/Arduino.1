Idea - 
Hybrid Approach:
For the Hydropnoics/water-quality use The Arduino to read the  analog values (pH, EC, water level) and then send the data  to the Raspberry Pi over serial USB. The Pi can then log the data, render a web front end, or run further analysis.

Calibration:
For pH and EC/TDS sensors
For pH and EC/TDS sensors especially, you must perform calibrations against known solutions. Document the calibration curves and – if possible – store calibration constants so your code applies the correct conversions. 

Libraries and Dependencies:
Ensure that you have installed the proper libraries (e.g., Adafruit’s libraries for DHT and smbus for I²C) and that you’ve enabled interfaces (SPI for the MCP3008, I²C for pH and EC sensors) in the Raspberry Pi configuration

Testing and Debugging:
Always test and verify one sensor at a time. Use serial monitors (or terminal output) to see your sensor’s raw values before applying conversion formulas.

By following these guidelines and adapting the sample code to your specific sensor models (and reading their datasheets for any idiosyncrasies in communication protocols), you’ll be well on your way to integrating a temperature sensor, pH sensor, EC/TDS sensor, and water level sensor using your Raspberry Pi and the Elegoo Uno R3. This approach lays a practical foundation for everything from environmental monitoring to automated hydroponics systems.

# Arduino.1
This is an approach that assigns the heavy lifting of sensor sampling to the Elegoo Uno R3 (acting as an I²C slave), 
while the Raspberry Pi (acting as the I²C master) periodically polls the Uno to retrieve up‑to‑date sensor values. 
In this architecture, the Uno continuously reads the temperature, pH, EC/TDS, and water level sensors and stores 
calibrated values in global variables. When the Pi requests new data over I²C, the Uno sends a formatted string with all sensor readings. 
This lets you leverage the Pi’s superior networking and data‑logging capabilities while using the Uno’s analog inputs and sensor libraries to sample the environment.

A quick note on wiring:
Because the Arduino operates at 5 V logic and the Raspberry Pi uses 3.3 V on its I²C 

Elegoo Uno R3 Slave Code (Arduino)
In the following code sample, the Arduino uses the built‑in Wire library to act as an I²C slave at address 4. 
It also uses (for example) a DHT11 for temperature/humidity, and analog inputs for the pH sensor, EC sensor, and water level sensor. 
(Make sure to adjust pin assignments, sensor types, and calibration coefficients based on your hardware setup.)

See --- main.cpp file

Explanation

1. Sensor Updates: The loop() function periodically reads the sensors and updates the global variables.
2. I²C Request Handling: The requestEvent() callback packs the latest sensor readings into a formatted string  and writes it to the I²C bus.
3. Calibration:  The Multiplication factors ( e.g., 3.5 for pH and 100 for EC) are examples. Use known calabration standards to fine-tune these.

Raspberry Pi Master Code (Python)
Using the Python  (or ) library, the Raspberry Pi initiates I²C communication to request the latest sensor readings from the Uno.
see ----- main.py file

Explanation:
I²C Master: The Pi uses  to communicate on the I²C bus.
Data Request: The  function issues a read transaction. The Uno’s response—the formatted string of sensor values—is then decoded.
Polling Frequency: The Pi polls every 2 seconds, matching the Uno’s update frequency.

Advantages of This Architecture
Dedicated Sensor Sampling: The Uno handles all analog sensor readings and real‑time updates without being limited by the Pi’s lack of analog inputs.
Enhanced Data Processing: The Raspberry Pi (as master) can concentrate on data logging, network transmission, or running a GUI dashboard.
Clear Role Separation: This design leverages the timing‐sensitive tasks on the Arduino while using the Pi’s computing power for more advanced data processing and remote communication.

Below is a set of further enhancements that not only improve error‐handling through a handshake protocol but also add a web‑based live dashboard on the Raspberry Pi. This design builds on the previous architecture where the Elegoo Uno R3 acts as the I²C slave and continuously updates sensor values while the Raspberry Pi polls the Arduino over I²C. Now we add a simple structured message protocol (with start/end markers, an error flag, and a checksum) for reliability and a Flask‑based web dashboard that displays the latest sensor readings in real time.

1. Enhanced Arduino (Elegoo Uno R3) Slave Code

In this updated Arduino sketch, the sensor readings are packaged into a message that includes:
• A start marker (e.g. “#”) and an end marker (“$”)
• Labeled sensor values for temperature, pH, EC, and water level
• A status flag indicating whether any sensor reading failed
• A simple checksum computed over the message (excluding the checksum field)
You can then have the Pi verify that the message is valid before processing.

see file ----- main1.cpp

How this helps

The message starts with “#” and ends with “$” so that the master can easily detect the entire packet.
Including a status flag ( when OK or  if an error occurred) and an appended checksum () improves error checking and data integrity on the Pi side.

2. Enhanced Raspberry Pi (Master) Code with Error Handling

On the Raspberry Pi, the updated Python script now does the following:
• Reads the I²C block data and converts it to a string
• Checks that the message has the correct start/end markers
• Extracts and validates the checksum
• Parses the sensor values only if the data is valid

see file main1.py

How this helps
The master code validates both the structure and the checksum of the sensor data.
In case of a format error or checksum mismatch, the script prints an error message and ignores the faulty reading.

3. Building a Live Web Dashboard on the Raspberry Pi
We can now integrate a Flask‑based web dashboard that polls the updated sensor readings and displays them in real time. The following example uses threading to keep sensor data continuously refreshing in the background. The web server exposes both a JSON API and an HTML dashboard interface.

see file app.py

3.2 Dashboard HTML Template (templates/dashboard.html)
Create a folder named "templates"  in the same directory as "app.py"  and inside it create a file named dashboard.html

How this helps:
Threaded Sensor Polling: The background thread running in sensor_pulling_thread() continuously updates a global variable with the latest valid sensor data.

REST API Endpoint: The /api/data route serves JSON data for other clients (like JavaScript running on the dashboard).

Live Dashboard: The HTML page uses JavaScript to poll the API every 2 seconds and update the webpage in real time

Together, these enhancements create a robust system where the Elegoo Uno R3 reliably samples sensor data and communicates it to a Raspberry Pi master with added error detection. The Pi not only validates the message integrity (using start/end markers and a checksum) but also powers a live dashboard that provides a user-friendly view of your system status.
You now have a foundation to even add further improvements—from more advanced error handling and reconnection logic on the Pi to authentication and historical data logging on the web dashboard.
